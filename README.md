Hi my name is Nayeli, I ended up making a little questionaire to determine which Hamlet character are you. It is 10 questions, and you have four different outcomes. Hamlet, Ophelia, Gertrude and Cladius. If you haven't read or watched Hamlet, I definitely recommend doing that before taking this quiz. As some questions and final outcome messages correlate to what happens in the play. 

Instructions: you can download the repository and just double click on the html file in order to start your quest :D
